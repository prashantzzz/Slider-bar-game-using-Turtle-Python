# Slider bar

Modules used:
This is a game made wholly using turtle module in python 
For sound, I have used a module named winsound which is already installed in python
For pausing a process, I have used a module named time which is already installed in python

In case there is any module error, write this in the command line:
pip install winsound
pip install turtle
pip install time

Instructions for playing:
Run the file 'slider_bar.py' using any IDE
Place all the images(.gifs), sound(.wav) along with the python(.py) file in same folder
Try to press 'p' at the time when the slider stays between the green bar
If you did it correctly, the green bar will light up and next slider will start to move
